# BCG-X-GenAI-Job-Simulation
## Financial Chatbot Prototype

### Overview
Under the BCG Tech Hub initiative, I developed a prototype of a financial chatbot called 'FinBot' using Python for the BCG X GenAI Job Simulation, offered via Forage. This cutting-edge tool is capable of simplifying predefined and precise information about the financial performances of three of the largest companies: Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, over fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023 and assisting in user queries respectively.

### Features
Any of the following sorts of financial queries are offered assistance with rule-based logic from the chatbot:

- Total Revenue
- Net Income
- Total Assets
- Total Liabilities
- Cash Flow from Operations
- Percentage Revenue and Net Income Growth
- Average revenue growth per year

### Technology Stack
'Finbot' is capable in exploiting the inherent potential of Python manipulations on large financial datasets and reports to transform them into easily accessible information that will be used to make informed decisions. This kind of interface engages the user and ensures that responses are clear.

### Future Enhancements
The prototype lays down vision for future capabilities, integrating similar programs through which organisations and professionals would be able to interpret large data efficiently. This proof-of-concept uses the processing power of Python in mass financial data manipulation, processing it to make sense from a gigantic dataset to simple information so that decisions will be correctly made within any organisation. In addition, the interface improves user engagement with the interactive ability that still presents clear answers.

### Conclusion
I am committed to transforming how global financial services engage with financial data, ultimately preparing to set a stage for more user-friendly experience.
